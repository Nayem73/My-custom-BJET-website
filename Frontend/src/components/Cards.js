          <p className='testimonial__about'>Software Engineer from Thesaurus Inc.,Japan</p>
          <p className='testimonial__text'>I was a BJET trainee in their 9th Batch. We attended classes 5 days a week, for 5 months. Everyday we learned something new about the Japanese language, Culture and Business Etiquettes. Every week, we were given the opportunity to have direct conversations with Japanese people online. Even after I was done with the training, I got tremendous support during my Visa application. Everything I learned from BJET has made adapting to the Japanese lifestyle a lot easier. I feel confident to approach people in Japan and they also appreciate that I invested my time to learn about their culture.</p>
